# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
The following project is an assignment from the Machine Learning and Deep Learning material which consists of 3 tasks + bonus. Task 1 is to create the best prediction model to predict "Churn Status in Banking" by comparing 3 Supervised Learning model evaluations using Model Optimization Methods (hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, etc.). Task 2 is to segment the data using clustering method. Task 3 is to create a simple artificial neural network with perceptron model for MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset. As for the bonus, it is to compare 3 different configurations with a wider/deeper model.
